An app was created to guide people through the infinite ways in which they can recycle items made of plastic, wood, glass, etc.. As they recycle, they can end up receiving gifts! Learn more about the app here. To spread our movement, we hold events and workshops. We could discuss and educate people about a certain problem or make fun workshops in which we teach them how to recycle.",
